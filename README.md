# gaia-sort
An inventory sorter for gaiaonline.

## read these warnings or I'll judge you for messing it up.

- Created in Google Chrome in like an afternoon, so not necessarily compatible with other browsers (though I have no idea why it wouldn't be)
- adds a button on the bottom right of your window. **Do not press it until everything has loaded.**
- This script isn't the most efficient, so with larger inventories it may take a few minutes to sort. Just do something else and check back once in a while.
- Afterwards you have to drag an item to trigger gaia's change detection. I recommend the last item in the list because it's always going to get sent to the back anyways.
- The ordering method is not fool-proof, so things might be out of place here and there. Just save and refresh the page for good measure and drag things around like normal.
- If you have a better idea of what you're doing than I do, message me on twitter @ mmt_n_ or gaia @ mmtn and I'll give you editing rights to the github.
